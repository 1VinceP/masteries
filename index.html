            Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

<!-- The DOCTYPE html tag at the top of an HTML file tells the browser to read the follow its directions for reading HTML elements. Without it, the brower
     would go into 'quirks mode'. This means that the layout will present a nonstandard behavior, such as Internet Explorer 5 behaved before the 
     widespread adoption of web standards. Essentially, DOCTYPE html tells the browser to use a standardized format when displaying it's content. -->

<!-- A semantic element is an element with a meaning. One such example would of a <form> tag. A form tag tells you that it's contents are some form of field
     that will take a user's input. Another example would be the <header> tag. This tells you that it's contents will most likely be displayed at the very
     top of the page, and may even contain some nav elements. These types of elements don't prevent the user from using them in places they typically shouldn't
     be used, but it is best practice to follow the semantics of the element so that other people looking at your code will have an easier time understanding
     what each piece does. Using a custom tag is generally a bad idea, as that tag may become standardized in the future. There are also better ways to define
     an element, such as it's class or id. -->
